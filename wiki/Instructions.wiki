  # Create a subversion repository dump using svnadmin: `svnadmin dump /path/to/repository > svndump.dump`
  # Launch Subversion Dump Editor and load the file into the program using the "Open Dump" button in the tool bar.
  # Select a revision from the revisions drop down.
  # Select a node from the nodes list.
  # Edit the node content.
  # Save your edits using the "Save Content" button in the tool bar.
  # Repeat for all edits you wish to make.
  # Click the "Export Dump" button in the tool bar and save the dump. (I recommend saving as a new file and not replacing the original)
  # Create a new subversion repository. (You could delete the old repository and recreate it but do this at your own risk)
  # Load your edited subversion repository using svnadmin: `svnadmin load /path/to/new/repository < new_svndump.dump`
