== Description =================================================================
Subversion Dump Editor parses a provided dump file, allows the editing of the
data then recreates the file making sure the dump file remains valid.


== Documentation ===============================================================
1) Create a subversion repository dump using svnadmin:
   svnadmin dump /path/to/repository > svndump.dump
2) Launch Subversion Dump Editor and load the file into the program using the 
   "Load SVN Dump" button in the lower left corner.
3) Select a revision from the revisions drop down.
4) Select a node from the nodes list.
5) Edit the node content.
6) Save your edits using the "Save File" button in the lower right corner.
7) Repeat for all edits you wish to make.
8) Click the "Save SVN Dump" button in the lower left corner and save the dump.
   (I recommend saving as a new file and not replacing the original)
9) Create a new subversion repository.
   (You could delete the old repository and recreate it but do this at your own
    risk)
10) Load your edited subversion repository using svnadmin:
    svnadmin load /path/to/new/repository < new_svndump.dump

Keep an eye out for errors produced by svnadmin. If you find any it is possible
the edited dump wasn't recreated correctly. If this happens please file a bug
report (see "Bug Reporting" below)


== Requirements ================================================================
Python 2.6 (lower versions should work but untested)
wxPython (Version 2.8.9.2 tested, lower versions should work)

== Bug Reports =================================================================
If you discover a bug in the software please file a bug report at:

Also report any errors that svnadmin might create about the dump file being
invalid.
